# Winter Hacker
Best Winter Hacks To Get You Through The Toughest And Longest Season Of The Year.

The project is submitted to the hackathon **Hackcoming**


## Inspiration
Winter is here and is a tough time of year for many. The days are long and cold, and weather extremes can not only strike at a momentâ€™s notice, but they can bring treacherous and dangerous conditions.
Winter. It's the darkest and often the coldest of the seasons, but with chill and snowfall comes the holiday season, and ample moments for cozy retreat and hibernation. Who doesn't love curling up with a winter cocktail by the fireplace, snuggling up with a blanket, and indulging a bit?


## What it does
We want to provide a platform that suggests the best hacks to get you through the toughest (and longest) season of the year. So we added a list of the very best winter life hacks and features to get you through the wintertime of the year. Learn To make the most of this season with the best winter hacks.


## Image Classification
Summer and Winter Season Classification using Image Processing and Machine Learning Methods. Users can upload everyday household items to know how effective or weak it is in winter to fight cold weather.


## How we built it
To categorize items in my wardrobe suitable for winter, I need to have a model that is trained to solve that task, and to train such a model I need data. The Database contains several datasets. In this project, the Category and Attribute Prediction Benchmark was used. This dataset contains diverse clothes images from different categories.


## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Tailwind CSS
- Python
- Flask
- Cockroach DB
- Google Cloud
- Twilio
- GoDaddy.com
- Tensorflow

## Use of CockroachDB
We have used CockroachDB as a primary database because it is an easy-to-use, open-source and indestructible SQL database.

## Twilio
We used Twilio to make a Whatsapp Bot that can suggest if your clothes are enough for winter or not. When we send an image to the Twilio Bot, it makes a Query to a Cloud Server which enables our Machine Learning model to recognize the clothes.

## Machine Learning Model
We used TensorFlow as a library for our Machine Learning Model. We used Keras for detecting the Clothes and Providing their Output.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to collaborate with the new teammates but it somehow finished the Project on Time. Getting hold of the backend We had a tough time getting the backend work done and sorted but WE DID IT! 

Integrating both front end and backend Merging the source files and JavaScript codes appropriately to call the function and showing up in the front end was daunting but gained a happy ending finally.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
That we had a Fun Weekend. We are proud of the final project we built. We learned a lot while working on the project not just technically but also time management. We are proud we could complete the project and deliver a beautiful fully functional Hack this weekend.

Hosting using custom domain For the first time we went with a very quirky domain name from GoDaddy and it was very interesting because we learned a lot as a team and it so yeah we're thrilled and proud we went with a challenging task this time.

## What we learned
We Learnt a Lot about Using Twilio along with TensorFlow. It was a fun experience attending this Hackathon. Backend. We learned a lot in terms of backend and got our skills tested for real this time while we had a hard time getting the backend and front end integrated.

Time Management.
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things altogether. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing out our work and focusing on multitasking. Extremely excited for all the teachings we had got through this hack.

Hosting.
We learned how to claim a custom domain from GoDaddy and make the hosting work out.
